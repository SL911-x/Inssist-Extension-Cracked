# Inssist-Extension-Cracked
Inssist (Instagram Assistant) is a free Chrome extension that lets you upload Instagram, upload photos and videos, organize and pre-organize posts, post articles, view followers, send DMs, and more. Not only can you download Instagram videos from your computer, but you can also play videos from IGTV, News and Reel. In our experience, these images worked well. Itâ€™s currently the only Chrome add-on that supports video recording on computers. The steps for this are similar to the Instagram app on your smartphone. The content expression has two dimensions.
